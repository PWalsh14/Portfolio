    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated and driven individual with a strong foundation in computer science, which I have pursued academically since my GCSEs, through A-levels, and beyond. My passion for mathematics and problem-solving has naturally led me to hone my skills in programming, with extensive experience in Python, Java, and HTML. Coming from a multicultural background—my family is Colombian and Irish—I am fluent in Spanish, which has deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity and adaptability in various settings.<p>

        </p>

            Beyond academics, I have a longstanding commitment to sports. I have competed in tennis at a national level since the age of six, an experience that has instilled in me the importance of hard work and resilience from an early age. I am also the captain of my football team, a role that has taught me valuable leadership skills, responsibility, and the ability to inspire others. Additionally, I enjoy staying active and meeting new people, as these pursuits bring balance and broaden my perspective.</p><p> </p>
            
            As a twin, I have grown up learning the importance of respect, equality, and understanding, particularly in my attitude toward women. These values are central to my interactions and collaborations with others. I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills, both technical and interpersonal, to create meaningful impact in every environment I am a part of.</p>
